Description:
    This Project demonstrates the TIME SERIES VISUALIZATION of the Unemployment Rate of United States across the years starting from 1976 till 2016.
    
I have developed this web based application by collecting the data from the website: http://www.bls.gov/data/ and by using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and D3.js.
